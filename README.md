# assignment-06

I have set up a ‘monorepo’ project with a client and server folder, so that I can manage and separate my code.

I have deployed both my client and server code to Render.

I have a GET route on my server which returns data.

I made sure my client can interact with server and also display the data from my server

I made sure that the user is be able to interact with the web page and see some kind of result from interactions.

I created a working API route in my server snf a fetch request is successfully made to the server and returns data and its results are rendered onto the page.
